## Hi there 👋 this is Mika Kishimoto!

I’m a **Junior Frontend Developer** with a strong background in **Graphic Design, Art Direction and UX/UI**.

I’m focused on growing as a frontend developer, combining **clean, maintainable code** with a strong **visual and user-centered mindset**.
My goal is to build interfaces that are not only functional, but also clear, usable and well thought-out.

<h2>🌱 Currently</h2>

🔭 I’m working on my **portfolio** and on new projects where I combine my background as a **designer** with my path as a **junior frontend developer**.

🌱 I’m learning and practicing:
- Git & GitHub
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Basic database concepts using MySQL

I’m especially interested in understanding how things work behind the scenes, beyond the visual layer.<br>
I believe functional websites are built when design and development are deeply connected, and when both logic and visuals work together to create better experiences.

<h2>💻 Experience</h2>

Before focusing on frontend development, I’ve been working professionally as a **Graphic Designer, Art Director and UX/UI Designer**.

My experience includes:
- Designing digital interfaces and landing pages
- Working with UX/UI principles, grids and responsive layouts
- Building and maintaining design systems
- Collaborating with clients and multidisciplinary teams
- Translating ideas and concepts into clear visual solutions
